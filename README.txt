== Description ==

This is a simple widget that will randomly display one of the four Ripple.org buttons on your WordPress sidebar. It also tracks how many clicks have been sent. I have only tested it on WP 2.3 - 2.5 but I don't see why it wouldn't work on earlier widget-enabled versions.

[0.5.0]: Fix broken images
